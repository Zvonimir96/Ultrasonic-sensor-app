# About
Desktop application created for displaying the measurement of temperature and distance measured with ultrasonic sensor. Application is a tool that students use to compleat laboratory exercises. Sensors are wired to a STM32 microcontroller that reads the data and sends the readings to PC via serial communication. Application decodes the data and displays it on a user interface that allows students to find errors in the measurements and draw conclusions about how the ultrasonic sensor works. 
Documentation for STM32 microcontroller can be found at the [link](https://github.com/deanfraj/SNZR_BMP280).
To run the application, locate the executable file under the path Senzor app/build/main/main.exe
